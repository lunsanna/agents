My name is Sanna Lun. I am originally from Hong Kong but now I live in Helsinki Finland. 
I am a career changer. I used to work in communications and event management. I retrained as a data scientist in 2018 - 2024. 
I love all kinds of noodles - ramen, pho, rise noodles. I love knitting - it's my creative outlet. I also love reading, mostly fiction but also sometimes non-fiction.
